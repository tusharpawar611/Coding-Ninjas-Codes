// Diameter Of Binary Tree
// Send Feedback
// For a given Binary of type integer, find and return the ‘Diameter’.
// Diameter of a Tree
// The diameter of a tree can be defined as the maximum distance between two leaf nodes.
// Here, the distance is measured in terms of the total number of nodes present along the path of the two leaf nodes, including both the leaves.
